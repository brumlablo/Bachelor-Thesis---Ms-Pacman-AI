# Intelligent reactive agent for the game Ms.Pacman

## Bachelor Thesis

This thesis focuses on artificial intelligence for difficult decision problemes such as the game
with uncertainty Ms. Pacman. The aim of this work is to design and implement intelligent
reactive agent using a method from the field of reinforcement learning, demonstrate it on visual
demo Ms.Pacman and compare its intelligence with well-known informed methods of
playing games (Minimax, AlfaBeta Pruning, Expectimax). The thesis is primarily structured
into two parts. The theoretical part deals with adversarial search (in games), reactivity
of agent and possibilities of reinforcement learning, all in the context of Ms. Pacman. The
second part addresses the design of agentâ€™s versions behaviour implementation and finally
its comparison to other methods of adversarial search problem, evaluation of results and a
few ideas for future improvements.
